# Recursive AI-Extended Self Audit

This Open Knowledge Format bundle documents the concepts, prompts, data, implementation, and interpretive decisions for the recursive AI-extended-self audit of public consumer–AI conversation corpora.

## Start here

* [Research program](overview.md) - Purpose, research question, and unit of analysis.
* [Ontology](ontology/) - Extension levels, recursive stages, consumer scope, labels, and boundaries.
* [Prompts](prompts/) - Exact v5 audit rubric, output schema, and continuation protocol.
* [Workflow](workflow/) - Corpus construction, automated classification, and human review.
* [Evidence](evidence/) - Manually adjudicated clear, potential, and negative cases.
* [Decisions](decisions/) - Methodological choices and their consequences.
* [References](references/) - Canonical code, datasets, outputs, and external standards.

## Bundle status

The v5 automated audit is running with zero recorded errors. The latest fully reconciled reporting boundary is line 32,747: all 5,054 automated clear or potential candidates through that boundary have been manually adjudicated exactly once, and the process diagram is frozen there. Candidates generated after it await a later frozen review. Manual outcomes at the boundary are 280 clear, 4,622 potential, and 152 none; the separate calibration record is excluded. The ontology and production prompt remain unchanged, and corpus-wide counts remain incomplete.

## Provenance

This bundle follows [Open Knowledge Format v0.2](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/open-knowledge-format/blob/main/SPEC.md). Concepts derived from project files identify those files in `sources`; interpretive concepts remain `draft` until the research team verifies them.
